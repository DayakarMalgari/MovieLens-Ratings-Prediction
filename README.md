# MovieLens-Ratings-Prediction
Build Models to predict the movie ratings.

Tasks performed 

Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Balancing,
Build Classifier Models - Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNeighbors,
Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree, Random Forest
and Deep Neural Network

Note: As input features are all binary, none of the
models came up with reasonable accuracy except Decision Tree and
Random Forest which use tree based algorithms
